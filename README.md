# Machine-Learning-Battery-SOC-Estimaton-Electric-Vehicles


This repository contains the codes to implement a data driven framework to predict the state-of-charge (SOC) of Lithium-Ion Batteries in Electric Vehicles applications. The codes provided in this repository have been developed as part of a project about Machine Learning applied to Lithium-Ion Batteries research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The results illustrated in this repository have contributed to the paper "Data driven estimation of electric vehicle battery state-of-charge informed by automotive simulations and multi-physics modeling" published in the Journal of Powe Sources in 2020.
